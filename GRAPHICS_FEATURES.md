## Technical Implementation

### Shader System
The `RealisticShader` class provides:
- `apply_ambient_occlusion()` - Darkens surfaces
- `apply_directional_light()` - Lambert shading
- `apply_distance_fog()` - Atmospheric effects
- `add_specular_highlight()` - Blinn-Phong specular

### Texture Generation
The `ProceduralTexture` class provides:
- Noise-based texture variation
- Bilinear interpolation for smoothness
- Configurable variation intensity
- Seed-based reproducibility

### Building Renderer
The `RealisticBuildingRenderer` class provides:
- `draw_building_3d()` - Isometric 3D buildings
- Automatic window placement
- Floor-based detailing
- Shadow calculations

### Color Application
The `apply_realistic_terrain_colors()` function:
- Takes biome, height, and moisture maps
- Calculates surface normals from heightmap
- Applies directional lighting
- Returns RGB color array
- Optimized with numpy operations

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Terrain colors pre-calculated once
- Roads pre-rendered to surface
- Building colors randomized per building
- Static layers cached as pygame surfaces

### Rendering Optimization
- LOD system reduces detail at distance
- Frustum culling skips off-screen objects
- Batch rendering of terrain and roads
- Individual building rendering with culling

### Memory Usage
- Terrain surface: ~0.75 MB for 512x512 grid
- City surface: ~0.75 MB for 512x512 grid
- Color arrays: Temporary, freed after caching
- Total overhead: ~2-3 MB for graphics

## Graphics Pipeline

```
1. World Generation
   ├─> Generate terrain with heightmap and biomes
   ├─> Calculate moisture map
   └─> Generate city layout with buildings

2. Pre-Processing (One-time)
   ├─> Apply realistic terrain colors
   ├─> Calculate surface normals
   ├─> Apply directional lighting
   └─> Cache to surface

3. Per-Frame Rendering
   ├─> Update camera position
   ├─> Calculate visible bounds
   ├─> Render terrain (cached surface)
   ├─> Render roads (cached surface)
   ├─> Render buildings (per-building LOD)
   └─> Render NPCs

4. Post-Processing
   ├─> Apply UI overlay
   └─> Flip display buffer
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Basic Graphics)
- Flat single-color terrain
- Simple colored rectangles for buildings
- No shading or depth
- ~30 draw calls per frame

### After (Realistic Graphics)
- Multi-color terrain with lighting
- 3D buildings with windows
- Shadows and depth perception
- ~50 draw calls per frame (optimized)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for even more realism:
- **Normal mapping** for terrain detail
- **Parallax scrolling** for depth
- **Particle systems** for ambient life (birds, leaves)
- **Weather effects** (rain, fog, snow)
- **Dynamic time of day** lighting
- **Street lights** at night
- **Vehicle traffic** with headlights
- **Animated water** with reflections
- **Cloud shadows** moving across terrain
- **Building interior lighting** (visible through windows)

## Usage

The enhanced graphics are automatically enabled when running the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:
1. Generate terrain with realistic colors
2. Apply height-based shading
3. Render roads with texture variation
4. Draw 3D buildings with windows
5. Optimize rendering with LOD

No configuration changes needed - everything works out of the box!
