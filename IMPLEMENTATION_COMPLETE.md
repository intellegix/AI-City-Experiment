## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### LOD System Architecture
The LOD system uses a manager-observer pattern:
- `LODManager` tracks all LOD objects
- `SimpleBuildingLOD` manages 3 geometry levels per building
- Updates every 0.5s (not every frame) for efficiency
- Automatic show/hide based on camera distance

### GPU Instancing Implementation
Uses Panda3D's `instanceTo()` method:
- Creates template geometry once
- Instances share vertex buffers
- Different transforms per instance
- Dramatically reduces GPU load

### Object Pooling Pattern
Generic pool implementation:
- Pre-allocates objects on startup
- `acquire()` reuses available objects
- `release()` returns objects to pool
- Tracks statistics (reuse rate, peak usage)

### Touch Input Pipeline
```
Touch Hardware
    ↓
Windows Touch API (ctypes)
    ↓
TouchInputManager (events)
    ↓
VirtualJoystickManager (logic)
    ↓
TouchUIManager (rendering)
    ↓
_handle_touch_input() (integration)
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Touch Hardware Required**: Full 10-point touch requires Windows 10/11 tablet
   - **Workaround**: Mouse simulation enabled by default

2. **MSAA Disabled**: No multi-sample anti-aliasing
   - **Mitigation**: Clean geometry design minimizes jaggedness

3. **LOD Pop-In**: Visible when objects change detail levels
   - **Mitigation**: Smooth distance thresholds (60m/150m/400m/600m)

4. **Object Pool Fixed Size**: 150 max agents
   - **Mitigation**: Configured to match MAX_NPC_COUNT
