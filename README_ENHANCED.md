- `vehicle_system.py` - Vehicle spawning system
- `world_3d_enhanced.py` - Main 3D world integration
- `city_generator.py` - Road network and zones
- `ai_behavior.py` - NPC behavior trees
- `pathfinding.py` - A* navigation

---

## üé® Customization

### Want More Buildings?
Edit `world_3d_enhanced.py` line 119:
```python
max_buildings = 100  # Change from 50 to 100
```

### Want More Vehicles?
Edit `world_3d_enhanced.py` line 160:
```python
vehicle_count = 50  # Change from 30 to 50
```

### Want Different Spawn Rates?
Edit `vehicle_system.py` lines 268-280:
```python
self.spawn_weights = {
    VehicleType.SEDAN: 0.30,  # 30% of vehicles
    VehicleType.BUS: 0.05,    # 5% of vehicles
    # ... adjust as desired
}
```

### Add New Building Style:
See `ENHANCED_SYSTEMS.md` for detailed customization guide

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'panda3d'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Xbox Controller Connected!" not showing
1. Connect controller via Bluetooth or USB
2. Press any button to wake it
3. Relaunch the simulation

### Low FPS
- Reduce building count (edit line 119 in world_3d_enhanced.py)
- Reduce vehicle count (edit line 160)
- Close other programs

### Buildings/Vehicles not appearing
- Check console for error messages
- Verify all modular system files exist:
  - procedural_buildings.py
  - vehicle_system.py
  - city_generator.py
